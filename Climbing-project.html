 <p>
      As an exercise, you really canâ€™t do better than climbing. Indoor climbing
      will improve all aspects of your physical condition. You will see
      improvement in your balance, flexibility, and agility and develop both
      upper and lower body strength. Best of all, you will burn calories at a
      higher rate than most strenuous workouts and will do it before you know
      it.
      <br/>
      Climbing gyms give you an enjoyable venue for social interaction with like-minded people. It's a place for trust building, camaraderie, and self confidence.
<br/>
This is a fun sport for everyone, from novice, sport, competitive, to professional climbers it's an amazing activity or even lifestyle.
